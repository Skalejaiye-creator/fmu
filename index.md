### COVER LETTER

Dear Florida Memorial University Hiring Committee,

Florida Memorial is already a winner and I’m not applying to rebuild. I’m applying to elevate.

This past season, I served as the sole assistant coach at Lincoln University, helping build the program essentially from scratch. We had no private gym. No scholarships. No housing. No national tournament affiliation. I wasn’t paid a salary. I drove hours from Los Angeles to support the team, ran 5 a.m. practices by myself, and brought in VertiMax and training equipment out of pocket, because I believed in what we were building.

In just over two months as the head of recruitment, I personally recruited and built a full roster from across the U.S. and internationally, players from France, Guadeloupe, Nigeria, Australia, Canada, Washington, Arizona, and more. Every single one of them paid full tuition to be part of our structure. That effort generated over $165,000 in tuition revenue, and helped us finish third in the conference, win our division, beat a scholarship-funded NAIA program, and produce three all-conference players in our first season.

My blueprint isn’t theory. It’s operational. I’ve already proven it works and now I’m ready to scale it inside a program with resources, history, and winning expectations.

KourtVision, my proprietary player evaluation system, uses a 0–100 Key Player Index based on eight traits to translate film into fit, projection, and role clarity. It removes guesswork from recruiting and helps me build rosters that actually win.

The Program Bible, my Slack + Notion-based operations system, runs everything off the floor: scout prep, academic check-ins, communication, accountability, leadership development, and daily scheduling. It brings order to chaos and gives coaches time back while giving players the structure they need to grow.

But systems only work when they’re tied to something real. That’s why I lead through The K.A.Y.S. Way a cultural framework grounded in Knowledge, Accountability, Yearning for Excellence, and Selflessness. It’s not a tagline. It’s how we live. My players know the standard on the court, in the dorms, and across campus.

Florida Memorial doesn’t need a reset. It needs a head coach who can take what’s already working and press real structure into it from recruiting to leadership to daily ops. That’s what I do. And that’s what I’m ready to do here.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I’d be honored to carry forward your tradition and build a national standard rooted in discipline, clarity, and system-level excellence.

Coach Sammy Kalejaiye

## SECTION 1.3 – SYSTEMS AT A GLANCE

At Florida Memorial, I won’t just bring a coaching style, I'll bring two fully operational systems that run everything from recruiting to player development to scout prep.

These aren’t concepts. They’re tools I already use to lead programs.



KourtVision – Evaluation & Projection Engine

A proprietary 0–100 Key Player Index that evaluates every recruit across 30 plus traits: Physical Tools, Athleticism, Skill Level, IQ, Defense, Motor, Productivity, and System Fit.

Used to define player roles, build development plans, and structure rotation decisions with clarity.



The Program Bible – Operational Leadership System


**A fully integrated platform that runs:**

Player communication

Scout and practice planning

Academic accountability

Culture and leadership tracking

Development check-ins and staff roles

Built to function with no budget, no assistants, and no shortcuts, and now ready to scale inside a fully resourced program.



1.4 – Why Systems Matter

I’ve built programs with no scholarships, no gym, no league, and no staff and still won. Not because of hype. Because of systems.

KourtVision and The Program Bible weren’t created for theory. They were created out of necessity to replace the resources I didn’t have.

KourtVision evaluates talent with precision, using film, context, and an 8-trait model to project roles and fit across levels. No guesswork. No bias. It tells the truth, and it helps me build rosters that actually work.

The Program Bible is how I lead. It tracks every rep, every standard, and every leadership moment from player check-ins to scout prep to dorm accountability. It’s not software. It’s a real culture engine.

Together, these systems didn’t just help me survive under pressure, they helped me scale structure without support.

At Florida Memorial, I won’t be starting from scratch. I’ll be bringing in a system that’s already operating and now finally has the platform to thrive.




## SECTION 2.1 – FOUNDATIONAL VISION

This is not a rebuild it’s a platform to scale.

FMU already has back-to-back 20+ win seasons, Sun Conference success, and national tournament experience. The foundation is in place. What’s needed now is systemization, retention, and year-round structure that produces pros and sustains high-level culture.

That’s exactly what I helped build at Lincoln, and it’s what I’m ready to bring to FMU with real systems, verified results, and a leadership model already in motion.


**My vision is built on clarity:**

Play fast: with pace, purpose, and spacing

Win with structure: not hype or hope

Build pros: physically, mentally, and emotionally

Recruit with discipline: using the KourtVision system to evaluate and project every piece

Retain the right ones: through culture, leadership, and calendar-based development

This isn’t about making another tournament run. It’s about building a national NAIA brand known for toughness, pace, and structure. And I’m ready to lead that climb.




## SECTION 2.2 – THREE-YEAR BUILD. FIVE-YEAR STANDARD.

Florida Memorial doesn’t need a rebuild. It needs a system that turns momentum into dominance.

This section outlines the full trajectory: a 3-year plan to establish a national contender, and a 5-year blueprint to sustain and replicate elite results.




### YEAR ONE – LEAD WITH STRUCTURE

Install the full system: spacing, tempo, shot selection, defensive communication, substitution rhythm

Build the culture: talk, reset huddles, body language, emotional discipline

Evaluate roster with KourtVision: define roles, build individual development plans, establish retention standards

Prioritize local recruiting: South Florida first, JUCO/prep second, bouncebacks third

Launch leadership model: captains, accountability partners, calendar-based accountability

Goal: 25+ wins, win West Division, Top-25 national ranking, NAIA tournament win




### YEAR TWO – SCALE THROUGH RETENTION

Returners become culture carriers: lead scout, accountability, and locker room tone

Add 3–4 high-level transfers with system-fit and leadership voice

Expand staff roles: assign film, scout, practice planning, and player development tracks

Launch content strategy: player branding, practice media, recruiting reach

Play up: schedule D1/D2 opponents for exposure and pace

Goal: Win Sun Conference, reach NAIA Sweet 16, finish Top 15 nationally




### YEAR THREE – COMPETE FOR NATIONAL HARDWARE

10-deep, system-built roster with emotional maturity and execution standard

KPI systems drive role decisions and growth tracking

Film feedback becomes daily rhythm: system-led corrections and development

Staff begins coaching tree trajectory: assistants lead major segments

FMU brand recognized nationally for system, toughness, and player outcomes

Goal: NAIA Final Four, Top-10 national ranking, legitimate national title contention




### YEAR FOUR – SUSTAIN AND SEPARATE

FMU becomes a regional recruiting hub and national brand

Players lead scout, development sessions, and program culture

Expanded community presence: youth mentorship, events, summer showcases

Staff development proven: assistants promoted, interns trained, model refined

Goal: Return to NAIA Final Four, compete for national title again




### YEAR FIVE – LOCK THE STANDARD

Full roster built on FMU identity: tough, vocal, skilled, accountable

All-Americans and pro-level athletes developed through internal systems

Players contribute immediately overseas and at high levels

Former assistants lead programs across the country, creating coaching tree reach

Goal: Win the national title. Create a structure that can win again.



I’ve already built teams with no gym, no housing, no scholarships, and no league and still won.

Now I’m ready to scale that blueprint inside Florida Memorial, elevate what’s already working, and lead this program all the way to the top.

The system is ready. The standard is clear. Let’s build it.




## SECTION 2.3 – BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE WINNER

Winning for one year is easy. Building a program that wins every year, that takes structure.

Florida Memorial is already on the map, but now it’s time to build the version that lasts: a program that recruits with precision, develops with intention, and retains through culture. That’s how you move from contender to cornerstone.

This is exactly what I’ve done at every level. I’ve built systems with no scholarships, no gym, no staff, and no resources and still created winning environments, high-character rosters, and professional outcomes. That doesn’t come from hype. It comes from habits.


**Here’s how we build a sustainable winner at FMU:**




### RECRUITING SYSTEM: KOURTVISION KPI

Every player evaluated on a 1.0–10.0 scale using my KourtVision Performance Index

System grades: Physical Tools, Skillset, Mental Maturity, System Fit, Projection

Results tracked across NAIA, JUCO, D2, and D1 levels

Players recruited by fit, not hype and graded for retention, not just talent

Pipeline focus: South Florida toughness, national JUCO/prep bouncebacks, and international upside




### CULTURE MODEL: THE K.A.Y.S. WAY

Knowledge — Players understand the system, their role, and how to lead

Accountability — Feedback is blunt, clear, and applied across the board

Yearning for Excellence — Daily growth mindset built into film, practice, and recovery

Selflessness — We play connected, vocal, and with shared purpose




### PRACTICE & PLAYER DEVELOPMENT

Five-Segment Practice Structure: Mobility, Competitive Finishers, Concept Block, Team Segment, Standards Wrap

Every drill ties into our system spacing, decision-making, and tempo philosophy

Players graded using shot selection models (Green/Yellow/Red) and KPI growth tracking

Off-court habits tracked via The Program Bible class, weights, meetings, film




### RETENTION & LEADERSHIP PIPELINE

Returners developed as captains with film and communication roles

Individual development plans (IDPs) mapped every 4 weeks

Leadership voice is taught: we train tone, timing, and emotional consistency

Assistants given real ownership: scout, development teams, summer buildouts

Staff retention becomes program strength, internal promotions and loyalty through clarity



The goal isn’t just to win, it’s to build something that holds when the pressure hits.

This is how Florida Memorial becomes a model NAIA program: through discipline, leadership, and structure that doesn’t break when the lights get bright.

If I can build that with no resources imagine what we’ll do here.




## SECTION 2.4 – WINNING WITH LIMITED RESOURCES

What I built at Lincoln wasn’t theory, it was pressure-tested reality.

No scholarships. No dorms. No practice gym. No league affiliation. No recruiting budget.

And still, I built a full roster, generated over $165,000 in tuition revenue, developed pros, and created a live system to run the entire program from the ground up.




**What I Walked Into:**

No gym (shared outside facilities or off-campus courts)

No housing or meal plan, players paid full tuition

No NAIA/NCAA conference only SWS affiliation

No scholarships, gear, or recruiting budget

No support staff I ran operations, recruiting, scouting, and skill developement




**What I Built Anyway:**

15-man roster with full buy-in and leadership clarity

Players from JUCO, international, high school, and bouncebacks

Full recruiting infrastructure with KourtVision evaluation and development plans

Practice calendar, scout structure, and discipline system all built from scratch

$165K+ in tuition brought in through recruiting, onboarding, and player trust

31 college players developed | 6 pros trained | 0 excuses made



If I could do that with limited resources…

Imagine what I’ll do with Florida Memorial across my chest.




## SECTION 2.5 – HBCU FIT & INSTITUTIONAL ALIGNMENT

I don’t just understand HBCU culture I live in alignment with it.

I’m a Black man who leads from structure, not slogans. And I know what it means to coach other Black men with discipline, clarity, and respect for what we carry.

This isn’t just basketball. It’s legacy, leadership, and life prep.

And that’s exactly where my system thrives.



Why This Is the Right Fit

I’ve coached in under-resourced environments where presence, trust, and clarity mattered more than gear or hype.

I’ve mentored Black athletes who didn’t need a motivational speech, they needed someone who wouldn’t flinch when things got real.

I don’t coach for attention I coach for discipline, development, and identity
My systems are built to grow men who lead on the court, in the dorm, and later in life. Not just guys who can run actions.



What I Bring to an HBCU Program

Structure rooted in daily accountability because our guys can’t afford confusion. This could be the difference between life and death as they transition into manhood.

KourtVision: A real evaluation model that gives athletes clarity, not false promises of professional riches.

The Program Bible: A system that enforces culture, builds voice, and holds leadership daily.

A coaching identity that holds both love and discipline without compromise.



As a Black man, I know what our players face.

I know what it feels like to grow up without handouts, and to earn every inch of opportunity through clarity, presence, and grind.

That’s what I bring to an HBCU: not projection, but structure.

Not talk, but trust.

This isn’t a surface-level alignment this is why I coach.

And Florida Memorial University is exactly where that mission belongs.




## SECTION 3.1 – RECRUITING PHILOSOPHY

I don’t recruit for hype, I recruit for fit.

At Florida Memorial, our recruiting process will be rooted in structure, evaluation, and trust. I don’t chase stars. I build systems. Every player I recruit is evaluated through film, rated through my KourtVision platform, and filtered for long-term fit before we ever offer. That’s how we out-recruit programs with bigger budgets. We don’t guess, we grade.


**Our recruiting philosophy is built around five core principles:**

Evaluation over emotion. Every prospect is scouted through film and graded before contact. No assumptions. No shortcuts. If they don’t fit our tempo, spacing, and communication standards, we don’t pursue them no matter how talented they are.

System-based filtering. We recruit players who can play in space, talk in coverage, and compete with maturity. If they need constant motivation, they’re not a fit. If they play fast, make great decisions, and lead without being asked we close them.

Clarity builds trust. Every player we offer knows exactly what role we see for them. We walk them through the depth chart, their projected role, and what their growth plan looks like inside our system. That’s how we avoid false promises, and that’s how we retain the right guys.

Pipelines, not randoms. I recruit through pipelines I’ve already built, JUCOs, prep schools, South Florida high schools, and overseas academies. I’ve signed players with no scholarships to offers because they believed in the structure. At FMU, with resources, that same process becomes even more dangerous.

The right players stay. Our evaluations include emotional maturity, off-court discipline, and calendar readiness. We use The Program Bible as part of onboarding. If they can’t handle structure, they won’t make it. If they can, they grow, and become leaders of men.

I’ve signed players who paid out of pocket. I’ve convinced families to commit to a system without gear, dorms, or a conference. Because I recruit with clarity. And at Florida Memorial, that clarity becomes a competitive edge.




## SECTION 3.2 – KOURTVISION PERFORMANCE INDEX (KPI)

KourtVision is my proprietary evaluation system designed to bring total clarity to the recruiting and roster-building process. It eliminates hype and guesswork by converting film, performance data, and system context into a clean, 0–100 Key Player Index (KPI) score.

This isn’t about clout. It’s about precision.


**Each athlete is evaluated across 30+ traits in categories like:**

Physical Tools

Athleticism

Skill Level

Playmaking & IQ

Defense

Motor & Intangibles

Productivity (stats + context)

System Fit

Every trait is graded on a 1–10 scale. But this isn’t just math it’s projection. The final score reflects the player’s role, level, and long-term value within our system.

Each recruit or returner is then assigned to one of our structured teams (Varsity, Development, or Postgrad), with full scholarship, NIL, and offer source tracking built in.
I can tell you, today, exactly what we need and exactly who fits.


**Sample Tier Translation:**

96–100: Pro-Ready

90–95: High-Major D1

83–89: Mid-Major D1

76–82: Low-Major D1

70–75: High-Level D2 / NAIA Star

65–69: D2 Contributor / Top NAIA Starter

60–64: NAIA Rotation Player

54–59: D3 High-End Contributor

50–53: D3 Bench / Developmental Tier

Below 50: Below College Level / Not Evaluatable

Why It Matters


**KourtVision gives me immediate clarity on:**

Who’s a system fit and who isn’t

What a player’s role should be today, and where they can grow

How to align a development plan, offer structure, and recruiting timeline

Whether I’m evaluating a pro prospect or an NAIA glue guy, I don’t guess.

I rate, project, and recruit based on what wins.

And that’s what KourtVision was built to do.




## SECTION 3.3 – PIPELINE STRATEGY

I don’t build rosters off one player. I build pipelines that keep delivering.

At Florida Memorial, my recruiting network is already aligned with how we play: fast, vocal, emotionally tough, and system-disciplined. These aren’t one-time commits — they’re long-term relationships that produce year after year because the people who send me players trust what I build.


**We recruit through structure not randomness. And here’s where the flow starts:**




### SOUTH FLORIDA FIRST

Homegrown toughness, tempo, and scoring guards

Ties to Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach JUCOs and HS coaches

Underrated players who compete and bring energy from Day 1

Local recruits built to represent Florida Memorial with pride




### NATIONAL PREP & POSTGRAD CONNECTIONS

Trusted relationships with high-level programs in California, Arizona, Texas, and Georgia

Players who’ve lived in structure: film, pace, coverage, and leadership roles

Built-in academic support from their programs = easier onboarding and eligibility

Staffs that know our system and send the right kids because we develop and win




### JUCO & BOUNCEBACK LANE

KPI evaluated JUCO players who are system-ready and vocal from Day 1

Mid-major bouncebacks looking for leadership, exposure, and a path back to the top

We win these battles by being more honest, more structured, and more growth-minded than their last stop

Every bounceback is graded if he’s not ready to lead or listen, he doesn’t fit




### INTERNATIONAL & ACADEMY NETWORK

Trusted prep pipeline with international exposure including full-pay athletes

Players already used to travel, structure, and training blocks

Underrated upside especially in bigs and vocal combo guards

I’ve placed internationals at the NAIA and D1 level and they stay because the culture holds




### DEVELOPMENT TEAM FLOW

15–20 players/year who train, get academically prepared, and grow into system-ready contributors

These players buy into structure, trust the plan, and contribute when their moment comes

We use our KPI model to track them even before they play we’re developing without wasting minutes



This isn’t a one-class plan. This is a recruiting system that feeds itself.

At Florida Memorial, we won’t just reload. We’ll pipeline year after year.

Because when you build the right relationships, the roster never runs dry.




## SECTION 3.4 – CLOSING STRATEGY (EXPANDED)

Recruiting is one thing. Closing is another.
At Florida Memorial, we won’t just be judged by who we scout we’ll be judged by who signs. That’s where we win.




**How I Close Recruits:**

System-Based Pitch

We lead with how they fit. Not a dream. Not a generic role.

I walk them through clips, coverage, shot selection, spacing rules, and their projected impact using KourtVision.

Role Clarity + Growth Path

Every recruit hears the truth: Day 1 role, what’s required to elevate, and how we track it.

I don’t promise minutes. I promise a blueprint.

Family + Inner Circle Trust

I speak to parents, trainers, and mentors the same way I speak to the player.

No hype. No manipulation. Just structure and a system that holds.

Structured Decision Model

Recruits know where they stand, how long they have to decide, and what happens if someone else commits first.

It’s respectful, honest, and competitive just like our program.

Proof From the Past

I’ve signed full-pay internationals with no gym, no housing, and no league.

I’ve convinced families to commit without ever seeing the school because the system is real.

At FMU, that same system now has brand, resources, and credibility behind it.




## SECTION 3.5 – DEVELOPMENTAL TEAM STRATEGY

Florida Memorial already has a development team and that’s a competitive advantage. But at most schools, development squads are treated like a side project or holding tank.

Not here.

At FMU, our development team will be built with real purpose as a structured extension of the varsity system, with the same standards, same culture, and a real growth path for players.




**Who We Recruit for Developmental Roster:**

Underrated or undersized players with high motor or elite intangibles

International or academic-gap players willing to pay full tuition

Full-pay NAIA bouncebacks looking to reestablish structure

3–5 redshirt-level freshmen who need weight room and culture reps




**What Development Players Get:**

Full practice access with second-unit reps and scout team integration

Film review, culture meetings, and KPI development plans

Individual check-ins and onboarding through The Program Bible

Built-in path to move into varsity rotation tracked through KourtVision




**Why It Works:**

We never run out of bodies the gym is always competitive

Walk-ons understand the system from day one

Role clarity eliminates confusion about playtime or status

Development guys become plug-and-play culture fits by Year 2

At Lincoln, I am currently on track to have 20+ player developmental group and multiple teams.

At FMU, we’ll elevate what already exists and build a development unit that reflects our varsity standards from day one.




## SECTION 3.6 – RETENTION MODEL: BUILDING PROGRAM STABILITY

Recruiting is only half the battle. The other half is retention and it’s one of the most overlooked metrics in college basketball.

At Florida Memorial, my goal isn’t just to sign the right players. It’s to keep them.


**How We Retain Players:**

Role Clarity from Day One – Every player knows their projection, role tier, and growth plan through KourtVision.

Consistent Touchpoints – Weekly check-ins, calendar accountability, academic logs, and leadership review inside The Program Bible.

Visible Development Plans – Players track their own progress across film, skill, weight, and intangibles.

Culture Buy-In – Captains are trained to lead with presence, talk, and truth. They hold the locker room before staff ever has to.


**What We Avoid:**

Surprise transfers due to unclear roles

Cultural drift from non-contributors

Overreliance on new faces to reset culture every year


**Retention Metrics I Track:**

Year-over-year player return rate

Transfer out rate vs. transfer in rate

Player academic standing per semester

Bench satisfaction and second unit engagement

This isn’t just a feel-good system. It’s data-backed, player-anchored, and rooted in how I build programs.

And when players know what they’re growing into they stay.




## SECTION 3.7 – KOURTVISION MATCHUP SIMULATOR

Powered by the KourtVision Performance Index

The KourtVision Matchup Simulator is a tool I created to bridge the gap between roster analysis and real scout preparation.

It lets me compare two full teams using player KPI ratings factoring in positional mismatches, level fit, trait gaps, and overall system alignment. With one input, I get a full positional breakdown, a projected point spread, and matchup commentary that reads like a high-level scout.


**Inputs:**

Team A: Player names + KPI ratings

Team B: Player names + KPI ratings


**Output:**

Matchup breakdown by position (color-coded)

Average KPI comparison across each team’s rotation

Projected outcome (e.g., “+6.5 in favor of Team A”)

Commentary line (e.g., “Team A has a frontcourt mismatch and stronger defensive motor”)


**Use Cases:**

Scout prep for upcoming games

Internal KPI-based scrimmage planning

Head-to-head roster simulations in recruitment or postseason strategy

Once fully linked to my player database, the simulator will auto-pull roster presets (Vision 8, Opponent 5, etc.) and instantly simulate matchups.

This isn’t just an evaluation engine it’s a full scout support system built to predict outcomes and give real-time role clarity.

And it’s already in development.




## SECTION 4.1 – PRACTICE PHILOSOPHY: PURPOSE, TEMPO, AND PRO DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS

We don’t run practices to get loose, we run them to build professionals. Our structure is rooted in pace, discipline, and pro development clarity. Players know they’re being coached for the next level and hold every rep accountable to that standard.

At Florida Memorial, our practices are the engine behind system clarity, player development, and emotional discipline. Every rep is filmed. Every segment is timed. Every player knows why they’re on the floor and what they’re being measured against.


**Core Philosophies That Guide Every Day:**

Tempo is a Weapon – We don’t walk anywhere. Transitions are tracked. Warmups are pace-based. This forces conditioning, urgency, and accountability.

Film Is Active – Every practice is filmed, sliced, and fed into the Growth Lab. Missed reps are tagged. Voice slippage is charted. Shot value is reviewed before percentages are even discussed.

KourtVision Shapes the Plan – Each player’s lowest 2 KPI traits guide their daily focus. If a guard’s IQ and shot selection are yellow-tagged, their Concept Block drills will focus on pace, read clarity, and G/Y/R discipline. KourtVision isn’t separate from practice it’s what builds the plan.

Every Drill Builds System Fluency – Our reps mimic what we want to do in games: shot grading layered into breakdown shooting, spacing drilled with terminology (Lift, Drift, Delay, Ghost, Nail), and defensive coverage taught with automatic calls.

Voice Is Tracked – If you don’t talk, the rep doesn’t count. We log this. Captains are expected to lead without being asked.

Leaders Lead in the Fire – Every practice includes a “Chaos Segment” 2-for-1s, bad calls, momentum flips. Captains must anchor resets.


**Daily Timing Framework (Baseline Model):**

0:00–0:20 – Tempo Mobility + Skill Activation

0:20–0:40 – Competitive Block

0:40–1:10 – Concept Block

1:10–1:40 – Full Team Segment

1:40–2:00 – Culture Wrap




## SECTION 4.2 – SAMPLE PRACTICE PLAN: FILM-DRIVEN, SYSTEM-INTEGRATED

Theme: Scout Execution + Concept Clarity
Goal: Build communication under pressure, rep offensive reads and late-game spacing triggers
Practice Length: 2 hours

0:00–0:15 – Mobility + Skill Activation

Tempo warmup, charted shooting (lift cuts, relocations)

Sprint-to-talk transition drills

0:15–0:30 – Competitive Finishers

1v1 closeouts, 2v2 help recovery, rebounding ladder

0:30–1:15 – Concept Block

Delay actions, shot grading, ICE → Peel → Show

Voice and decision-making layered into every drill

1:15–1:50 – Full Team Segment

5-on-0 scout install → 5-on-5 live

Chaos cue: foul-to-freeze, trap-rotate, baseline action

1:50–2:00 – Decompression

Sprint for missed talk

Reset and anchor: coach + captain voice




## SECTION 4.3 – CONCEPT BLOCK BREAKDOWN: TEACHING DECISION-MAKING WITH FILM AND TERMINOLOGY

The Concept Block is where our system language, spacing structure, and KourtVision traits come to life. This is the foundation of our offensive identity not just how we teach reads, but how we teach decisions.


**Core Objectives:**

Build read fluency with pace and tempo control

Rep shot selection clarity using live G/Y/R grading

Translate individual KPI gaps into situational progressions

Layer in spacing and voice terminology in every action


**Teaching Rhythm:
We break the Concept Block into three layers:**

Language & Movement (3v0) – Spacing names and timing (Lift, Drift, Delay, Ghost, Nail)

Constraint Reads (3v3) – Force the player to make the correct decision: skip, drift, rescreen, or hold

Live Play (4v4 or 5v5 with Rules) – Players must apply decisions at full speed with accountability and spacing discipline


**Decision Progressions We Rep:**

Drift window vs. Nail help

Shot selection off lift cut vs. skip vs. downhill read

Delay action: swing-swing → drift → duck-in read

Post-entry → lift → backside ghost coverage


**KourtVision Integration:**

Guards with low IQ or System Fit traits are placed in high-read drills

Coaches cue players mid-drill: “Yellow read — delay it,” “Red shot — drift next”

Players self-tag their best and worst decisions in post-practice video review


**Voice Expectations:**

Every read has a verbal cue: “Drift now,” “Swing-Swing,” “ICE call next side”

Quiet reps don’t count. Red tags are issued for silence during decision breakdowns


**Shot Selection Model:**

Players call their shot in real time: “Green,” “Yellow,” or “Red”

Live override by coach if called wrong → immediate correction

Reinforced later through film to train alignment between feel and footage


**Why This Wins:**

We don’t just teach patterns, we build fluent decision-makers

Players know not just where to go, but when, why, and with what voice

Every drill builds habits that hold under scout pressure and fatigue

This is how we build system IQ; one read, one cue, one rep at a time.




## SECTION 4.4 – SCRIPTED & FULL TEAM SEGMENT FLOW: SCOUT EXECUTION UNDER PRESSURE

This segment is where we test decision-making, voice control, and system poise under scout conditions. We simulate real game flow and teach players how to lead through structure and manage pressure in rhythm.


**Purpose:**

Build scout fluency with voice and terminology

Rep late-game chaos situations with captain leadership

Assign roles based on performance, not status

Evaluate composure, clarity, and coachability in-game-like conditions

5-on-0 Segment: Install and Echo

Scout set install using system language: Delay, Swing, Ghost, Nail, Lift/Drift

Player-led walkthrough: each player must vocalize action as it’s repped

Repped at progressive tempo: 50% → 75% → 90%

Mid-script resets triggered by assistant coach: “Lift miss,” “Delay early,” “Re-set spacing”

5-on-5 Live Segment: Chaos + Clarity

Sequence begins with live scout action (2–3 sets in flow)

Chaos variable introduced: coach yells twist, foul call, or missed matchup

Players must adjust coverage, spacing, or sub


**Live reps include:**

Down 3 with 0:26 left

Full-court trap and rotate

Special teams baseline under set

Sub-in, scout call, and free-throw rebound recovery


**Substitution Pattern:**


**Rotations are tied to:**

Talk clarity in the walkthrough

Voice consistency during scout chaos

Leadership reset during free-throw huddle or defensive scramble

No rep is guaranteed players must earn their scout reps in real time


**KourtVision Application:**

Scout reps are tagged by System Fit, IQ, and Motor performance

Players with yellow or red tags are given verbal cue feedback post-rep

Leadership tone and emotional reset scored live and uploaded to player profile


**Why This Segment Wins:**

Scout becomes a language not just a list of plays

Leaders separate themselves through talk and poise, not highlight plays

Game-day prep is built on real pressure, not scripted comfort

This is where game habits are formed and where roles are earned before the lights come on.




## SECTION 4.5 – DEFENSIVE COVERAGE & COMMUNICATION SYSTEM: TEACHING VOICE UNDER PRESSURE

We don’t run a gimmick defense. We run a connected system rooted in talk, clarity, and accountability. At Florida Memorial, defense starts with voice and ends with trust.


**Defensive Identity Principles:**

Talk First, Action Second: If the coverage isn’t called, it doesn’t count. Voice precedes rotation.

Built on Anticipation, Not Reaction: Defensive maturity is shown in timing, not just hustle.

Anchor the System, Don’t Chase the Ball: Our players must rotate with clarity and stay emotionally locked even when the scout flips.

Core Coverage Package:
We don’t run a gimmick defense. We run a connected system rooted in talk, clarity, and accountability. At Florida Memorial, defense starts with voice and ends with trust.


**Core Coverage Package:**

ICE: Sideline push to flatten PnR, tag the roller early

Peel Switch: Emergency recovery, built on reaction + talk

Stunt + Recover: Disrupt gaps without full rotation

Switch: Used late or scout-dependent

Show/Recover: For slow-decision guards or mismatches


**How We Teach It:**

Players call coverage before it happens

Each rep charted; no talk = red tag

Recovery drills: Shell, 2v2/3v3, scramble, 5v5 scout-based reps


**KourtVision Focus:**

Defensive IQ, Motor, and System Fit evaluated weekly

Film review includes voice tracking, missed tags, and help calls


****Drill Progression:**

Coverage Language Walkthroughs: Players call ICE/Peel/Stunt/Switch before coach even throws the ball.

2v2 + 3v3 Recovery Situations: Tag responsibilities, recovery reads, switch accountability.

Closeout with Communication: One-word coverage calls. No voice = repeat.

5v5 Scout-Based Segment: Players must call matchups, echo coverage, and adjust on the fly.


**KourtVision Focus:**

Defensive IQ, Motor, and System Fit evaluated weekly

Red-tag tracking for no talk, poor reaction time, late help positioning

Recovery rating logged in player Growth Lab notes


**Why It Wins:**

Defensive culture is led by voice and corrected by structure

Mistakes are processed immediately not hidden on film day

Our players don’t just play hard they rotate with purpose and lead through clarity

At Florida Memorial, defense is our accountability system in motion.




## SECTION 4.6 – CHAOS, LEADERSHIP & COMPETITIVE RESETS: BUILDING POISE UNDER PRESSURE

At Florida Memorial, we don’t wait for adversity to test our players we build it into practice. Our competitive culture is taught through reset reps, late-game chaos, and captain-led voice drills. Leadership is not assumed. It’s repped, graded, and built over time.


**Why Chaos is Intentional:**

We simulate scout failure, bad calls, missed switches, and late-game breakdowns on purpose

Captains and vocal leaders are responsible for anchoring the response

Players learn to communicate, reset the team, and correct without panic


**Core Chaos Situations We Rep:**

2-for-1s: Voice and pace evaluation in transition chaos

Trap-and-Rotate: Response when the ball sticks or scout breaks

Foul-to-Freeze: Clock pressure situations where poise must hold

Momentum Killers: After a turnover or defensive breakdown who resets the group?


**Reset Drill Series:**

Silent Segment Flip: Mid-play chaos cue; captains must organize on the fly

Dead Ball Reset Reps: Huddles must happen fast, with energy and clarity

Voice-Triggered Substitutions: Only players who echo scout and lead talk earn game reps


**KourtVision Integration:**

Emotional Maturity, System Fit, and Motor are logged in chaos segments

Red-tag tracker flags who breaks rhythm, fails to reset, or hides in adversity

Growth Lab notes tied to each player’s response in competitive breakdown moments


**Leadership Evaluation in Action:**

Captains submit post-practice reflections on what slipped and who stepped up

Voice clips from scout or chaos segments are reviewed weekly

Practice film used to identify who de-escalated conflict and who fueled it


**Why This Wins:**

We don’t hope players lead; we train them to

Adversity becomes a muscle, not a mystery

Talk under pressure becomes our advantage

This is how we prepare for March in January.
Because teams that survive don’t win championships, teams that lead through adversity do.

Pressure busts pipes or it makes diamonds. We train players to become the latter.




## SECTION 4.7 – GAME WEEK STRUCTURE: RHYTHM, SCOUT, AND PLAYER OWNERSHIP

Game week at Florida Memorial isn’t about rolling balls out, it’s about building a rhythm that players can own. Every day has a defined focus, leadership responsibility, and scout integration layer. Our captains don’t just play in scout, they drive it.


**Weekly Flow Overview:**

Monday: Scout Install + Language Quiz
Walk through top actions, film scout broken down by concept (e.g., lift spacing, ghost series). Players quizzed verbally on opponent terminology, tendencies, and matchup expectations.

Tuesday: System Drill Reps
Rep scout coverage with voice: ICE, stunt, peel, switch. Echo terminology. Scramble reps built around known scout triggers. KourtVision assignments drive rep pairings.

Wednesday: Scout Chaos Day
Full-speed scout segments: 2-for-1s, foul-to-freeze, baseline actions, dead-ball leadership resets. Players expected to correct in flow. Silent reps = red-tagged.

Thursday: Situation + Special Teams Layer
Practice includes delay game, ATO plays, sideline O/D, and sub rotation timing. Players sub themselves in based on scout knowledge and voice.

Friday: Walkthrough + Reset
Controlled scout re-run at 70% speed. Final reminders, cue words, and emotional regulation checks. Captains run the walkthrough.

Saturday: Game Day Execution
Roles are already earned. Voice, poise, and discipline carry us not pregame hype.


**Player Accountability System:**

Voice reps are tracked Monday–Friday and shared during film

Coverage misses, slow recovery, and talk drops are noted daily

Players graded on talk-to-rep ratio and scout clarity


**Coach Delegation Model:**

Assistant 1: Scout action install + player matchups

Assistant 2: Coverage voice + sub rotations

Head Coach: Huddle tone, leadership correction, timeout response resets


**Why This System Wins:**

Players show up with clarity, not questions

Captains become the scout anchors

By Saturday, we don’t react, we execute

This is how we prepare for real basketball. Rhythm, structure, and standards that hold under pressure.




## SECTION 4.8 – FILM & SCOUT PROCESS: TEACHING WITH FOOTAGE, NOT FEEL

At Florida Memorial, film isn’t just reviewing its teaching. Every scout segment is reinforced with cut-ups, tags, and cue words that connect directly to our system language. Our players don’t just watch film. They learn how to talk through it, correct through it, and apply it in real time.


**How We Deliver Film:**


**Film sessions are broken into concept categories, not just clips:**

Drift decisions

Delay spacing vs. tag recovery

Nail cutter communication

Coverage voice breakdowns (ICE, Peel, Switch)

Clips are labeled with system terms, not just actions

Captains are assigned to lead breakdowns of opponent scout actions and voice performance


**Player Film Access & Breakdown Expectations:**

Players are expected to watch their individual scout matchups and voice tags before walk-throughs

Guards break down spacing, shot selection, and transition coverage

Bigs are cued on delay spacing, switch communication, and recovery reactions

Players must arrive with at least two clip notes (“He bails on switches,” “Can’t finish through contact”)


**Voice-Driven Scout Integration:**

Every scout clip has at least one required callout: no silent watch

Bench and in-practice talk compared to film: “Did you echo it on the floor?”

Voice confirmation graded during film playback


**KourtVision Alignment:**

Film clips are filtered through KourtVision tags (IQ, System Fit, Motor)


**Development players receive focused cutups showing:**

What elite looks like at their position

What their reps look like now

What needs to change, with system context


**Scout Teaching Rhythm:**


**Film is delivered in three phases:**

Preview Cutups: Players sent scout clips 24–48 hours out

Concept Session: In-practice film stop and echo corrections

Reinforcement Loop: Film is rewatched after reps to align feel and decision


**Why This Wins:**

Players build visual fluency; they don’t just react, they anticipate

Scout language becomes automatic because it’s reinforced everywhere

Our players know the scout because they’ve already lived it on screen

This is how we turn film from correction into confidence and how we teach players to think the game out loud.




## SECTION 4.9 – OFFENSIVE IDENTITY: FAST, FREE, AND SPACED TO SCORE

We play fast. We space wide. We let players express themselves and we hold that freedom accountable through voice, film, and decision-making clarity.

At Florida Memorial, offense isn’t just about scoring, it’s about energy, identity, and entertainment. We want fans on their feet, players in rhythm, and opponents chasing our tempo.
We don’t just run plays, we teach players how to play. Our offense is rooted in spacing, pace, and clarity. Every player knows where to be, what decision is expected, and what their shot profile is. The system creates rhythm. The habits create results.


**Core Principles:**

Spacing Is Sacred – Players know how to fill and read: corners, lift, drift, delay, nail.

Play Fast, Always – We don’t walk the ball up. We push tempo, generate early threes, and attack before the defense sets.

Freedom Within System – Players have room to express themselves, we teach reads, but also let flair and feel shine.

Entertain and Energize – Our pace, our threes, and our dunk-first mentality create an identity people want to watch.

Shot Selection Is Trained – Green/Yellow/Red model used in every drill, every film session, and every scrimmage.

Decisions Over Sets – We teach how to read coverage and tag help, not memorize plays.


**Offensive Vocabulary We Drill:**

Delay: Top trigger into flow spacing

Lift/Drift: Weak-side movement rules

Nail: Cutter zone + midline decision cue

Ghost: Slip or reject based on coverage

Swing-Swing: Ball movement trigger into second-side action


**Shot Selection System:**

Green: Paint touch finishes, open catch-and-shoot 3s, early-clock advantage layups

Yellow: Rhythm pull-ups, contested floaters, semi-open long 2s

Red: No-pass shots, off-balance stepbacks, early-clock isolation

Players call their shot live, we build their feel to match footage


**KourtVision Application:**

Players with low Skill Level or Playmaking IQ scores are tagged for pace/spacing decision drills

Development wings rep G/Y/R reads in every live scrimmage

Bigs work delay flow into dive/spread counters based on spacing language


**Flow Segments We Build Weekly:**

Transition into Delay

2-man ghost/roll combinations

Backside rescreens from lift/drift timing

Flow into trap-read passouts


**Role Expectations in the System:**

Lead Guards: Must push pace, talk early-clock triggers, and read second-side help. Charted on paint touches, voice, and transition G/Y/R shot creation.

Wings: Own 0.5 reads. Must lift on penetration, drift on nail cuts, and stay ready to shoot without hesitating. Repped in relocation and swing-swing decisions.

Bigs: Spacing anchors. Work delay-to-dive actions, ghost timing, and short roll IQ. Called on to initiate top spacing and backside screening flow.


**Tempo Rules + Early Clock Philosophy:**

First 7 seconds = open green light if spacing is correct and voice is called

Missed advantage = bounce out into Delay or Swing-Swing flow

Any early-clock red shot = red-tagged and reviewed on film

Missed lift or drift window = immediate stop and reset


**Player Development Inside the System:**

Shooters repped in transition relocation and deep lift catch-reads

Slashers taught to hit nail spacing and read second defender

Creators graded on talk-to-touch ratio and decision fluency in 4v4/5v5 scrimmages

Players build pro habits in a tempo they can carry overseas or into summer circuits


**Why This Wins:**

Offense becomes fluent, not memorized

Players score by understanding what’s green not forcing yellow

Opponents struggle to speed us up because our reads stay consistent

We don’t need 40 plays. We need 5 actions our players can execute against any coverage with clarity, pace, poise, and personality.

When fans come to a Florida Memorial game, they’ll see energy, threes, dunks, movement, and voice. We don’t just play basketball, we perform a system that’s fun to watch and hard to guard.




## SECTION 4.10 – DEFENSIVE IDENTITY: DISCIPLINE, DISRUPTION, AND VOICE

We get up. We pressure. We talk. Our gym is loud; you can feel us breathing on you. We’re not just active, we're accountable. At Florida Memorial, our defense carries the same personality as our offense: fast, loud, and relentless.

We’re going to be known as the rare team that can shoot 30 threes a game and still sit down and guard. We’re going to change games with our energy not just our talent. When teams walk into our gym, they’ll feel it before we even tip.

Our defense is built to disrupt not react. We want to control the tempo, pressure the ball without fouling, and rotate like a unit that’s been drilled for adversity. At Florida Memorial, defense is where our culture shows up loudest.


**Core Principles:**

Talk First – If there’s no voice, the coverage doesn’t exist. We train communication as a skill.

Guard the Ball – Everyone’s responsible. Containment is demanded from guards and wings — not just bigs.

Shrink the Floor – No direct lines, no open gaps. We rotate early and load up help.

Disrupt with Clarity – Coverage changes are made with purpose: ICE, Peel, Show, or Switch.

Finish the Play – Possession isn’t complete without a rebound and a voice reset.


**Defensive System Vocabulary:**

ICE – Side PnR push down to sideline help

Peel – Emergency switch with rotation recovery

Stunt – Controlled help without full rotation

Switch – On late clock or scout-specific matchups

Shrink + Recover – Load the help side, then scramble out


**Coverage Expectations by Role:**

Guards: Must navigate screens, tag help, and lead voice on-ball

Wings: Must rotate early, talk stunt/switch, and contest without fouling

Bigs: Communicate ICE/show early, anchor rebounding, quarterback backline


**Practice Accountability:**


**Every defensive segment is charted by:**

Talk rate

Coverage accuracy

Recovery effort

Emotional discipline

Silent reps = red-tagged. Miscommunication = reset the drill.


**KourtVision Application:**

Defensive IQ, Motor, and System Fit tracked weekly

Low-motor players assigned extra scramble and switch reps

Coverage tests built into Growth Lab to reinforce maturity and voice


**Why This Wins:**

Our defense communicates, rotates, and finishes

Every player knows the system and speaks it out loud

We don’t just want stops, we want habits that travel into March

Defense is our daily standard. We hold each other accountable. Everyone talks. Everyone rotates. Everyone leads.

We don’t just aim to win games; we aim to change them with how hard we play.

This is who we are. This is Florida Memorial defense.




## SECTION 4.11 – ANALYTICS SYSTEM: TRACKING WHAT WINS, TEACHING WHAT TRANSFERS

We don’t just believe in analytics we live by them. At Florida Memorial, our data isn’t outsourced. It’s built into the DNA of how we practice, how we scout, how we teach, and how we win.


**What We Track:**

Shot Value: Green/Yellow/Red shot tags in live scrimmage and charted practice segments

Talk Rate: Voice confirmations, coverage echoes, and leadership resets graded per player

Coverage Accuracy: ICE, Peel, Show, Stunt percentages tracked through live reps

Recovery Effort: Missed rotation and second-effort reps charted and tagged by role

Transition Efficiency: Paint touches, first 7-second threes, bounce-out discipline

Sub Impact: +/- data tracked in scrimmage based on energy, voice, and spacing value


**Where It Lives:**

Inside KourtVision — every trait reinforced by footage and live tagging

In our Growth Lab — red-tag reports, correction loops, and film annotation

On our practice board — weekly updates shared for player feedback and ownership


**Why It Works:**

Every player knows what’s measured and why it matters

Film clips are tagged with data, not just emotion

Practice becomes performance not just preparation


**Advanced Use:**

Lineup Data: Which combinations move the ball, space correctly, and sustain tempo?

Coverage Breakdown Trends: Are we missing more rotations on ghost or nail-side?

Scout Efficiency Reports: How well are we executing the 3–4 core actions the opponent runs?


**Why This Wins:**

We’re not guessing what wins we’re tracking it

Players understand why they’re playing and what needs to grow

Data becomes clarity, not confusion




## SECTION 5.1 – PLAYER DEVELOPMENT PHILOSOPHY: PURPOSE, PRESSURE, AND REAL PROGRESS

We don’t just develop players we build grown men. Every part of our development system is designed to create clarity, push emotional maturity, and prepare athletes for life after college basketball.

Our system is built on three pillars: purposeful repetition, emotional accountability, and real-world readiness. At Florida Memorial, development is not an extra. It’s the expectation.


**What Player Development Means Here:**

Skill training tied directly to system roles and game usage

Emotional growth coached through tone, response, and resilience

Leadership repped like ball-handling daily, layered, and visible

Identity shaped through discipline, standards, and system fluency

We train confidence, not comfort.

Reps happen when players are tired

Mistakes are corrected with structure, not shouting

Talk is tracked. Growth is logged. Players know how they’re doing and why it matters


**The Program Bible:
Every part of a player’s development from tone, energy, class performance, and scout trust is tracked inside The Program Bible. This creates clarity between:**

What a player wants to become

What the team needs them to be

What the standard demands right now


**Accountability and Growth Standards:**

Players are expected to lead within their lane

Every segment of practice has player-driven accountability from stretch to final huddle

Emotional maturity is monitored like shot selection: it gets better because it’s taught


**Why This Works:**

Players don’t guess what’s expected it’s taught, tracked, and reinforced

Development includes leadership, discipline, and emotional intelligence not just skills

Our players leave more confident, more prepared, and more valuable to the next level

This is how we create real growth the kind that wins games, earns trust, and changes lives.




## SECTION 5.2 – INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT PLANS (IDPS): CUSTOM PATHS, REAL ACCOUNTABILITY

Every player at Florida Memorial receives a development plan tailored to their role, readiness, and maturity. These aren’t checklists. They’re real training blueprints built to stretch the player and support their growth every step of the way.


**Plan Framework:**

Evaluated every two weeks

Based on in-practice performance, emotional response, system role, and academic tone

Logged and tracked inside The Program Bible

Coaches collaborate with players in building the plan it’s not given, it’s owned


**Structure of a Standard IDP:**

Role Objective: “Primary Ball Handler,” “Defensive Anchor,” “Spacing Shooter”

Skill Emphasis: 1–2 technical focuses (e.g., paint touch reads, post entry footwork)

Mental Growth Area: Scout trust, response to correction, or emotional consistency

Leadership Target: Assigned reps (e.g., film voice cue, recovery huddle, pregame talk)

Accountability Check: Weekly journal entry + coaching staff response reviewed 1-on-1


**Development Block Timeline:**

Weeks 1–2: Goal setting + early testing in competitive segments

Weeks 3–4: Film clips reviewed with the player, new decision reps inserted into live play

Weeks 5–6: Players evaluated on system clarity + leadership presence during scout


**Live Feedback Loop:**

Mistakes tied to the IDP are clipped and shown back to the player

Red tags used to track effort lapses, missed reads, or voice failures

Green tags reinforce what’s working and how to do more of it


**IDPs are also used for:**

Leadership promotion and voice trust

Minutes justification based on growth and role clarity

Transfer planning (if needed) with full context and support


**Why This Works:**

Development becomes a two-way street players help drive their plan

No one floats. Everyone has a focus, a checkpoint, and a staff member invested in their growth

The plan stays fluid, but the expectations never move

We don’t just build players. We build pros in how they think, train, lead, and live.




## SECTION 5.3 – ACADEMIC SUPPORT & PLAYER SUCCESS: HOLDING THE STANDARD ON AND OFF THE COURT


**Academic Accountability Framework:**

Every player’s GPA, class attendance, assignment completion, and tutor interaction is tracked weekly

Players complete an academic check-in form each Monday submitted into The Program Bible

Red flag triggers: missing assignments, GPA slip, poor class conduct addressed in 1-on-1 meetings


**Coach and Staff Roles:**

Head Coach leads academic culture talks every Friday reinforcing why school matters to career

Academic Liaison (within staff or partner) meets weekly with players flagged for support

Captains monitor teammate classroom energy just like they do in practice


**Support Systems We’ve Built:**

Player-facing ios system with assignment schedules, teacher contacts, and accountability calendar

Study hall check-in system monitored via The Program Bible logs

Staff-led “Grade Watch” sessions to forecast risk and support improvement plans


**How It Aligns with Our Culture:**

Players who lead academically earn more leadership voice on the court

We use GPA, classroom behavior, and academic initiative as a factor in minutes, trust, and leadership assignment

Academic growth is charted with the same intensity as defensive rotation or scout talk


**Real-World Alignment and Career Preparation:**

The Program Bible includes a mentorship and career prep module: resume planning, grad school prep, and career exploration tied to academic major

Players are expected to complete 2 mentorship check-ins each semester tracked and logged

Internship planning begins junior year, with staff support connecting players to alumni and partner networks

Leadership assignments include speaking engagements, community service coordination, and team-facing professional development tasks


**Why This Works:**

Players build the ability to manage structure, communicate with authority, and lead with responsibility

Our team GPA is not an accident it’s a reflection of our culture, tracked every day

Parents, professors, and administrators see the buy-in because we don’t just talk about standards we live them

This is how we turn student-athletes into grown men ones who know how to lead in a classroom, in a locker room, and in life.




## SECTION 5.4 – YEAR-ROUND GROWTH SCHEDULE: HOW WE BUILD ACROSS THE CALENDAR

We don’t grow players in bursts we grow them through rhythm, structure, and seasonal purpose. Player development at Florida Memorial is a 12-month system, built around intentional phases that match the calendar, the classroom, and the human growth cycle.


**Development Phases Overview:**


**Preseason (August–October):**

Focus: System teaching, conditioning, role clarity, voice installation

Activities: Film sessions, baseline evaluations, IDP launch meetings

Volume: High-rep, detail-focused, culture-first practices


**In-Season (November–March):**

Focus: Scout execution, role ownership, emotional leadership

Activities: Weekly IDP updates, scout reflection forms, Growth Lab check-ins

Volume: Trimmed for efficiency. High focus. More feedback than install.


**Postseason Reset (March–April):**

Focus: Self-assessment, recovery, next-step planning

Activities: Exit meetings, academic alignment, summer roadmap building

Volume: Light on-court. Heavy reflection and redirection


**Spring/Summer Build (May–July):**

Focus: Skill-specific growth, leadership maturity, physical transformation

Activities: Individual + small group workouts, captain-led player sessions, film study + voice training

Volume: Role-based. Players with more to grow do more. Minutes are earned before October.


**Why It Works:**

Growth is layered over time not crammed into off-days

Academic and athletic rhythms support each other

Players build year-to-year, not month-to-month

This is how we create a development system players can trust, parents can believe in, and programs can build on every day, all year long.




## SECTION 5.5 – EARNING ROLES, MINUTES & LEADERSHIP VOICE: THE REAL DEVELOPMENT LADDER

Nothing is given here, roles are earned, leadership is repped, and minutes are tied to maturity, discipline, and decision-making. At Florida Memorial, development isn’t just about getting better, it's about getting trusted.


**How We Define the Ladder:**

Level 1 – Learning the System: Understand the language, reps, and expectations

Level 2 – Earning Voice: Demonstrate poise, echo scout, lead in drills

Level 3 – Role Player: Trusted to execute spacing, coverage, and assignments on cue

Level 4 – Rotation Player: Ready to play extended minutes based on energy and reliability

Level 5 – Leadership Anchor: Runs scout segments, resets chaos, teaches other players


**How Minutes Are Earned:**

Through talk — not just talent

Through scout trust — not just scoring

Through consistency — not charisma


**Practice & Game Impact Criteria:**

Voice rating (graded in live scout, practice huddles, film sessions)

Emotional response during chaos drills or rotation breakdowns

Film discipline and Growth Lab reflection

Leadership initiative: Are you correcting teammates? Are you resetting the huddle?

Substitution readiness: Players must be ready to speak coverage, spacing, and matchup on every whistle or they don’t check in


**Role Progression in the Program:**

No one skips levels. Freshmen who start still begin at Level 1

Late bloomers are tracked and moved up based on leadership reps, not hype

Captains are voted by teammates but confirmed through accountability data


**The Program Bible Integration:**

Every player’s minutes and reps are linked to accountability logs

Weekly leadership rating discussed within the staff and relaid privately to players

Red-tag accumulation limits rotation trust it’s all tracked, not assumed

Players submit mid-season “Role Audit” reflecting how they’ve grown and where they’ve slipped


**Why This Works:**

Players understand exactly what’s expected to play

We remove politics and replace it with process

Leadership grows from accountability, not volume

Players gain confidence because they’ve earned their role the hard way and everyone in the locker room knows it

We don’t play favorites. We play the ones who earn it in the dark, in practice, and when no one’s watching. We play the ones who earn it in the dark, in practice, and when no one’s watching.




## SECTION 5.6 – PLAYER TRANSFORMATION CASE STUDIES: GROWTH YOU CAN SEE. IMPACT YOU CAN FEEL

We don’t talk about growth, we show it. Every case listed here reflects a player I personally developed through structure, discipline, and real accountability. These aren’t highlight reels, they're transformation stories built on purpose.

ORLANDO ROBINSON – From Non-Dunker to NBA Contract

Before: Couldn’t dunk, lacked confidence, considered goofy and unathletic

After: Lived with me, trained daily, developed footwork and shot, signed four NBA contracts

Focus: Emotional growth, physical transformation, daily discipline

OMARI MOORE – From Positionless to Mountain West POY

Before: No offers, no clear position, inconsistent handle

After: Developed into a high-level PG, became Mountain West Player of the Year, signed NBA contracts with Toronto and Milwaukee

Focus: PnR IQ, maturity, consistent leadership

J.Q. WILLIFORD – From Undisciplined to Pac-12 Guard

Before: Emotionally reactive, lacked role identity

After: Locked in as elite on-ball defender, signed with Oregon State

Focus: Defensive voice, scout discipline, emotional regulation

BO NGUIDJOL – From Invisible to Overseas Pro

Before: Unknown post, lacked presence

After: Developed into a stretch big, signed pro deal in Spain

Focus: Spacing IQ, motor, professional accountability


**Why This Matters:**

Every player listed grew because they were developed in a system that held them accountable in reps, in leadership, and in life

This isn't a theory. This is evidence.

This is how we build pros even when no one’s watching.




## SECTION 5.7 – CHARACTER, BRANDING & OFF-COURT GROWTH: PREPARING FOR THE GAME AFTER THE GAME

We don’t just coach the player we coach the man. At Florida Memorial, off-court growth is a core part of our development system. Players are trained to carry themselves with discipline, represent the program with pride, and step into professional life with clarity and purpose.




**What Character Means in Our Program:**

Self-awareness under pressure

Emotional discipline during conflict

Leadership when no one’s watching

Accountability when no one’s reminding

These aren’t abstract values. We coach them every day.




**How It’s Taught and Tracked:**

The Program Bible includes off-court behavior logs, tone rating entries, dorm accountability, and community presence

Captains and upperclassmen are given weekly leadership reps from huddle resets to class check-ins

Players are assigned reflection prompts tied to scout performance, emotional response, and personal growth moments

Red-tag behavior (lateness, attitude, selfishness) is documented and reviewed 1-on-1 not just punished, but coached




**Branding & NIL Readiness:**

We help our players understand how to own their brand with substance, not hype.

Players build their public profile around leadership, GPA, and scout voice not just points

NIL decks include: practice clips, community involvement, GPA standing, tone rating history

We help players speak clearly, write professionally, and present themselves in a way that earns trust from mentors, donors, and businesses

If you can lead in the film room, you can lead in a partnership.




**Professional & Personal Growth:**

Players are expected to participate in 2+ mentorship check-ins per semester

Resume building, career prep, and post-grad life planning is tracked inside the Program Bible

Alumni are involved not just as stories but as real-world resources for job placement and career feedback

Players speak publicly, serve at events, and learn to move in the world with presence




**Why This Matters:**

When a coach calls about one of our guys — we have more than stats to talk about

When a company considers an NIL deal — we have more than followers to show

When a player graduates — he’s not just eligible. He’s ready




## SECTION 5.8 – RETENTION & TRANSFER SUPPORT PHILOSOPHY: RELATIONSHIPS THAT LAST BEYOND THE LOCKER ROOM

Retention doesn’t happen by accident. It’s earned through trust, clarity, and consistent communication. At Florida Memorial, we don’t coach players like they’re temporary. We coach them like they’re family and we build systems that help them grow whether they stay or go.

We don’t fear transfers. We fear uncertainty. So we eliminate it through structure, dialogue, and honesty.




**How We Build Retention into Our Culture:**

Clarity of Role: Every player knows where they stand, what’s expected, and what’s needed to move forward

Accountability Logs: Energy, voice, effort, and scout discipline are all tracked inside The Program Bible no guessing, no favorites

Weekly Check-Ins: Staff meets with players to discuss minutes, growth areas, class alignment, and emotional health

Leadership Progression: Players who grow within the system get visible reps in scout, in huddles, in walkthroughs, in voice-led film sessions




**Preventing Transfer Frustration:**

If a player is struggling with playing time, we show them the film, the reps, and the roadmap to fix it

If a player feels underused, we walk through their IDP, their practice profile, and team need

We reinforce that leadership is more than scoring and that growth is more than touches




**How We Support Players Who Choose to Leave:**

Exit Meetings: Players receive a full breakdown of what they’ve learned, how they’ve matured, and what next steps we recommend

Coach-to-Coach Communication: We’ll reach out on a player’s behalf when that player handled things the right way

Highlight Reel + Growth Summary: We assist in creating film reels and one-page growth reports that show progress, maturity, and value

Emotional Closure: Players are treated with respect. Our message is: “We still want you to win, even if it’s not here.”




**Why This Works:**

Players feel seen — not used

Parents feel secure — because they’re part of the process

The locker room stays healthy — because resentment doesn’t fester and roles are clear

We don’t lose players to confusion.

We support players through honesty.

And we build a culture that outlasts transfers, rumors, or tough conversations because it’s rooted in truth.




## SECTION 6.1 – BUILDING THE K.A.Y.S. WAY

K.A.Y.S. stands for Knowledge, Accountability, Year-Round Standards and it defines everything we do. It’s not a motto. It’s a behavior system that governs how players live, train, speak, and lead even when nobody’s watching.



Knowledge


**Players are expected to know more than the scout. That includes:**

Opponent tendencies and personnel

Our full terminology, sets, and concepts

Their own role, matchup, and usage within the system

No guessing. No hiding. If you’re on the floor, you know your assignment.



Accountability


**We don’t coach effort we track it. Players are held responsible for:**

Voice reps (“no talk, no rep” is real)

Body language, posture, presence

Energy checks in team time, film, and lift sessions

The standard is enforced daily not emotionally, but structurally.



Year-Round

Culture isn’t seasonal. Offseason tone, weights, summer leadership everything is built with continuity. Players know what’s expected 12 months a year, and how behavior today affects minutes tomorrow.



Standards


**We don’t wait for a crisis to install culture. Every player is taught:**

What we expect

Why we expect it

What happens when it slips

There’s no mystery. There’s no guessing. The Program Bible tracks all of its scout engagement, tone rating, maturity check-ins, reset reps, and leadership moments. If it’s not tracked, it doesn’t get better.



This is what separates us from soft programs. The K.A.Y.S. Way builds disciplined, self-accountable leaders not just players who “buy in when things are going well.”




## SECTION 6.2 – DAILY STANDARDS PLAYERS LIVE BY

Standards are coached every single day. Not just with rules but with tone, language, posture, and presence. Players are held accountable to how they show up, how they speak, and how they respond in every environment.




**What Gets Coached Every Day:**

Voice – If you don’t talk, the rep doesn’t count. Period.

Posture – No slouching, no hands in pockets, no hoodies in walkthroughs.

Tone – No mumbling. No slang during teaching moments. Be clear, be sharp.

Energy – You don’t have to be loud, but you have to be alive.




**Examples We Enforce:**

Practice: No voice? The rep resets. No talk, no rep is non-negotiable.

Film: Phones away, eyes forward, leaders sit in the front row.

Weights: Early arrival is standard. Leaders check teammates before coaches do.

Team Time: No crossed arms. No emotional hiding. Presence is tracked.




**Language Rules:**


**Players are taught how to speak like leaders. That means:**

Full sentences. Clear voice. Eye contact.

No half-effort “my bads” — just corrections and solutions.

“Hype vs. Help” is real — you know when to energize vs. instruct.




**How It’s Tracked:**


**Every behavioral cue is tracked inside The Program Bible:**

Tone and voice scores

Missed reps and reset moments

Film engagement

Practice presence and posture ratings

We don’t wait until it’s a problem. We catch it early, coach it daily, and log it all.




## SECTION 6.3 – LEADERSHIP LADDER & CAPTAIN VOICE

Leaders aren’t chosen by popularity. They’re built through daily behavior. Our system develops voice from the ground up using a real ladder, real reps, and real consequences.




**The Leadership Ladder:**


**Every player is evaluated and developed based on this four-level structure:**

Level 1 – Tone Followers
Freshmen, new transfers, or anyone learning the standard. No leadership reps. Focus is on language, posture, and presence.

Level 2 – Culture Contributors
Must talk in drills, lead small groups, and correct teammates. Leadership is situational and earned.

Level 3 – Situational Leaders
Assigned scout team voice, warmup control, timeout resets. Coaches test them in high-pressure spots.

Level 4 – Captains
Chosen based on trust, not hype. Captains are the standard. They lead film, check tone, correct drift and carry it when coaches don’t.




**Captain Responsibilities:**

Lead pre- and post-practice huddles

Check body language before the staff does

Reset the group when tone dips

Meet weekly with staff for scout prep and team maturity review

Represent the program at events; no exceptions




**How It’s Tracked:**


**Every rep is logged inside The Program Bible:**

Voice scores

Leadership reps (scout, warmup, timeout)

Tone reset logs

Coach evaluations and peer surveys

If a captain can’t lead under pressure, they don’t stay captain.




**Why It Works:**

We don’t hope leadership happens. We coach it. We log it. We hold it.

There’s no guessing who the leaders are in our locker room it’s earned, and it’s obvious.




## SECTION 6.4 – TRACKING CULTURE: CONSEQUENCES, REPS, AND RESET MOMENTS

We don’t guess who’s slipping. We don’t wait until it’s a problem.

Culture is tracked in real time with logs, reps, and reset points built directly into our system.




**Three Tools We Use to Track Standards:**

Reset Reps
If a player misses a tone cue, body language standard, or fails a team behavior check it’s corrected on the spot, then logged. Reps are repped like skills.

Strike System
Every week, behavior is evaluated by staff. Repeated tone or discipline breakdowns are marked as Strikes and trigger loss of reps, loss of voice, or team-facing consequences.

Scout Logs
Players are scored on energy, tone, and execution every scout day. Scores are posted inside The Program Bible, and used to decide captains, minutes, and leadership level.




**Real Consequences:**

1 Strike: Warning + extra leadership reps

2 Strikes: Accountability assignment (film board, locker cleanup, tone check task)

3 Strikes: Loss of voice, team-facing conversation, minutes affected

This system protects the culture without drama. There’s no guessing. There’s no debate.




**How Players Reset:**

Re-earn tone credit through team huddles and scout feedback

Lead a segment (weights, warmup, or film cueing)

Private reset convo + staff evaluation logged in Program Bible

We don’t punish emotion. We coach maturity. Every player is expected to self-correct and grow with help, structure, and real-time feedback.




## SECTION 6.5 – PLAYER OWNERSHIP: INTERNAL COMPETITION & CULTURE DRIVERS

We don’t build culture for players.

We build it through them. Internal competition and role-based culture assignments give players ownership of tone, reps, and maturity.




**How We Build Internal Competition:**

Scout Team Wars – Leaders are challenged to win the day in talk, tempo, and execution. Staff grades energy and discipline, not just buckets.

Tone Battles – Two units compete to finish a segment with cleaner talk, crisper reps, better resets. Quiet leaders get exposed or elevated.

Captain’s Games – Captains draft teams for select drills or practices. They manage subs, correct teammates, and live the weight of tone control.




**Culture Driver Roles:**


**Every player is assigned a culture driver task based on behavior level:**

Freshmen – Locker room and gym reset crew

Level 2+ – Hype man, tone cop, water check, weights tempo

Level 3–4 – Film prep, scout board, injury recovery support, reset assignments

No player stands around. Everyone owns something. That’s the system.




**Program Bible Tracking:**

Culture Driver tasks are posted weekly

Leaders are evaluated on execution of non-basketball roles

Failure to lead = logged as tone breakdown (same as on-court slip)

Top performers earn gear rewards, voice reps, and captain votes




**Why It Works:**

We make leadership uncomfortable then coach them through it.

Players can’t hide. They either grow, or they slide. And we track both.




## SECTION 6.6 – COMPETITIVE CULTURE IS BUILT, NOT PREACHED

We don’t talk about toughness. We test it.

We don’t post quotes about grit. We build it into how we practice, how we correct, and how we compete every day.




**How We Build Competitive Culture:**

Live Segments Every Day – We compete in full-speed actions every single day. That includes decision-making, tone under pressure, and bounce-back after correction.

Score Everything – Rebounding drills. Transition breakdowns. Closeout reps. Every drill has a winner. Every drill has a consequence.

Talk = Points – In competitive segments, voice earns points. Silent reps are dead reps. Energy wins drills, not just buckets.




**Tone Reset Drills:**

When energy slips or voice fades, we don’t stop practice.


**We reset the tone with drills that force emotional control under fatigue:**

55’s

17’s

Silent Transition to Sprint Recovery

Team-on-the-Line Accountability Reps

These aren’t punishments. These are standards coached the same way as our sets.




**How It’s Measured:**

Daily winners posted inside The Program Bible

Culture ratings tied to practice performance, not just game stats

Players graded on how they respond to failure, correction, and fatigue




**Bottom Line:**

If your best voice comes when you’re winning, you don’t play here.

We build competitors who lead through adversity, not just survive it.




## SECTION 7.1 – STAFF PHILOSOPHY

I’ve had to run full programs essentially by myself with no assistants, no support, just a system and a standard.

That experience shaped how I lead: with clarity, voice, and development built into the daily structure. At Florida Memorial, I won’t just give assistants jobs I’ll give them growth.



How We Operate as a Staff

Defined Roles: Every assistant is responsible for a domain recruiting touchpoints, academic check-ins, scout segments, development reps, or dorm tone

Shared Standards: Culture isn’t my job alone it’s taught and tracked by every voice on staff

System Integration: Assistants post clips, calendar updates, and culture notes directly into The Program Bible



How I Grow My Staff

Feedback Loops: 1-on-1 meetings every 2–3 weeks to review film presence, tone, clarity, and voice

Practice Film: Coaches are graded on correction language, player response, energy, and segment control

KPI for Staff: Presence, timing, scout clarity, accountability ownership all tracked across the season

Leadership On-Ramps: Assistants are expected to lead portions of practice, walkthroughs, and development blocks with autonomy



Why It Works

Assistants don’t just survive they gain voice

Every coach grows within the system not around it

Staff retention improves because growth is visible and real

Players respect the voice of the whole staff not just the head coach

When you work in my program, you’re not just carrying cones. You’re being built to lead.




## SECTION 7.2 – STAFF DEVELOPMENT MODEL

I don’t want assistants who just survive the season, I want coaches who grow.

At Florida Memorial, my staff development model will be structured, intentional, and tied directly to voice, leadership, and system clarity. Coaching is a teachable craft, and just like our players, our staff will be coached to improve daily.

This isn't title-based staff. It’s a leadership-based one.




### DEVELOPMENT STRUCTURE

Weekly staff meetings include not just operations, but coaching growth segments

Each assistant will receive feedback on tone, teach-back clarity, and system command

Staff film review every 2 weeks: how you correct, how you connect, and how you manage moments

KPI-style growth logs for staff: presence, reliability, leadership ownership, and trust




### DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES

Scout team reps + walk-through leadership moments

Practice segment ownership: closeouts, concept blocks, or player development windows

Dorm, academic, and off-court culture roles

Slack system posts: calendar corrections, culture messages, film tags staff expected to contribute




### COACHING GROWTH TRACK

Year 1: Understand the system, lead with energy, earn trust in small group settings

Year 2: Take scout leadership, own segments of practice, lead culture messages

Year 3+: Mentor younger staff, contribute to recruiting board, run summer workouts




### HEAD COACH RESPONSIBILITIES

I meet with assistants every 3 weeks 1-on-1 to review growth, goals, and teaching voice

I give ownership based on consistency not politics

I coach assistants the same way I coach players: truth, tone, and structure

If an assistant shows they’re ready, I’ll give them more and I’ll advocate for their next opportunity



At Florida Memorial, assistants won’t just show up; they'll be sharpened.

We’ll grow our voices, build leadership habits, and develop coaches who can one day run their own programs.

Because great staffs don’t happen by accident. They’re built the same way as great teams.




## SECTION 7.3 – RESOURCE STRATEGY

We don’t make excuses, we make systems.

At Florida Memorial, our resource strategy will stretch every dollar, maximize every tool, and eliminate the chaos that slows down winning. I’ve built full programs with no gym, no scholarships, no housing, and no staff. That experience taught me how to run, lean, lead clearly, and win anyway.

Now I’ll bring that same precision to a program that already has the infrastructure and make it even stronger.




### STRUCTURE OVER SPENDING

Every resource, gear, software, travel, media must support player development, recruiting clarity, or competitive preparation

If it doesn’t move the needle in one of those three areas, we don’t need it

If we already have it we systemize it

If we can’t afford it we build it ourselves




### CORE RESOURCE TOOLS

The Program Bible

Central hub for calendar, communication, leadership, and accountability

Staff, players, and team managers all connected in real time

No missed meetings. No confusion. No last-minute panic.

KourtVision (KPI Recruiting Platform)

Player evaluation tool built to score every prospect (1.0–10.0) based on system fit

Tracks growth, retention, and roster need clarity

Already helped build full rosters with no scholarship dollars a huge asset at FMU

Hudl + Sheets Integration

Film + data tied together  shot value, rotation tracking, and effort metrics

Shared with players, clipped by staff, and layered into scout and development plans




### OFF-CAMPUS OPTIMIZATION

Travel meals pre-logged and tracked eliminate wasted dollars

Partnered gyms or backup practice space pre-confirmed each semester

Recruiting travel structured for pipeline touchpoints not just showcases

Shared ride system built into student calendar class to practice to recovery




### ACCOUNTABILITY

Every budget item tracked and justified — we don’t spend because it’s nice, we spend because it helps

Staff roles include managing key resource areas — film, ops, nutrition, gear

Roster built with clarity — tuition, aid, scholarship, and pipeline commitments tracked in one document

Gear ordering and season logistics pre-scheduled — nothing left to scramble



At Florida Memorial, our resources will be used better than anyone else’s.

Because we don’t just budget money we budget time, energy, and attention.

That’s how you turn a good program into a championship one.

And that’s exactly what we’ll build here.




## SECTION 7.4 – BUDGET & SCHEDULING STRATEGY

You don’t need a huge budget to run a high-level program you need structure.

At Florida Memorial, I’ll bring a budget model built on clarity, purpose, and competitive priorities. I’ve led full programs where every dollar mattered. That experience taught me how to build, travel, recruit, and win while staying disciplined.

This won’t be a wishlist. It’ll be a strategy.




### BUDGET PHILOSOPHY

Every expense must serve the system player development, recruiting, or competitive edge

If it doesn’t help us win or grow, it doesn’t get funded

Staff involved in budgeting but final alignment runs through the head coach

We plan early, spend intentionally, and track everything




### KEY SPENDING PRIORITIES

Recruiting Travel

JUCO, prep, bounceback, and local HS visits scheduled by calendar

Travel routes mapped by pipeline not popularity

Staff travel assignments rotated and logged in advance

We target players who fit not just tournaments that impress

Film & Data Integration

Hudl + KourtVision = film + evaluation system that saves thousands annually

All player data, scout prep, and development planning run through shared tools

Players and staff trained in usage nothing sits unused

Team Meals & Travel Logistics

Pre-scheduled meals, postgame nutrition, and rest stops all locked 5–7 days in advance

No surprise spending we use systems, not improvisation

Travel grouped by region to minimize cost and maximize rhythm

Gear & Operations

Gear orders follow a 3-year rotation (core, alternate, practice)

Managers trained on laundry, storage, and equipment upkeep

Staff handles operations roles (film, gear, dorms) before outside hires are considered




### TIME BUDGETING (EQUALLY IMPORTANT)

Calendar is pre-planned in 4-week blocks: class, practice, lift, travel, and film

Assistant coach assigned to oversee calendar integrity and daily schedule accuracy

The Program Bible used to sync all time-related ops no last-minute chaos



We don’t waste money and we don’t waste time.

At Florida Memorial, our budget won’t just reflect what we have it’ll reflect who we are.

Disciplined. Structured. Focused.

Because smart programs don’t win with more. They win with better. And that’s what we’ll be.




## SECTION 8.1 – SHOT SELECTION & OFFENSIVE EFFICIENCY

We don’t guess what a good shot is, we teach it, track it, and enforce it.
At Florida Memorial, every player understands how we score, why we score, and what shots we value. Our offense is built on data, language, and decision-making, not freedom without accountability. Shot selection is evaluated at the highest level: film, live tagging, and growth reports.


**SHOT GRADING SYSTEM
We use a color-coded system across practice, games, and film:**

Green: Paint finishes, open 3s (feet set), transition advantage shots, free throws

Yellow: Floaters, post-ups, rhythm pull-ups (late clock only)

Red: Off-balance, contested, early-clock isolation, panic shots


### INTEGRATION ACROSS SYSTEM

Hudl + KPI overlay: every shot tagged with context and charted

Weekly Shot Profile Reports: reviewed with each position coach

Green Rate = % of shots taken that meet elite criteria

Film sessions emphasize shot selection before percentages


**KPI CORRELATION
Shot selection is tied to:**

IQ (Playmaking): Did they make the extra read?

Skill Level: Were they in balance with space?

System Fit: Did they take the shot we designed?


### WHY THIS IS D1/NBA STANDARD

We teach context, not just spacing

We create green windows — not just shot attempts

Every decision is film-backed and projected forward




## SECTION 8.2 – POSSESSION VALUE, TURNOVER CONTEXT & STRIKE ZONE PASSING

We don’t just track turnovers. We dissect them with pro-level detail.


### TURNOVER CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM

Aggressive TOs – Within system reads, timing off

Execution TOs – Right read, wrong delivery (late, float, off-target)

Careless TOs – Jog passes, misreads, unforced errors

Pressure TOs – Caused by energy lapse or lack of poise under duress


### STRIKE ZONE PASSING

Defined passing targets: inside shoulders, chest-to-waist window


**Ball delivery graded for:**

Timing (late/early)

Velocity (floaters vs. punch passes)

Vision (missed help read, late weak side)


### POSSESSION-BASED PRACTICE DESIGN

7-possession segments tracked live

Possession Value Chart used in scrimmage segments: score, kill, turnover, poor shot

Players submit a possession reflection sheet weekly (film-supported)


### WHY THIS IS NBA STANDARD

Every pass is graded like a closeout: mechanics, impact, intent

Possession efficiency mirrors what elite programs use for late-game prep

Eliminates empty reps every decision is film-anchored




## SECTION 8.3 – HUSTLE & CULTURE METRICS

Energy is our baseline and we track it down to the detail.


### WHAT WE TRACK DAILY

First-to-floor recoveries (tagged live on Hudl)

Defensive sprint recoveries (transition effort grade)

Closeout effort vs. technique breakdown

Bench engagement: tone rating, talk confirmations, leader resets


### METRICS INCLUDE

Culture Grade (posted weekly): includes green/yellow/red tags from practices

Effort Index: composite score built from sprint reps, closeouts, and body language resets

Voice Confirmations: Echoed coverage calls graded in live drill and scrimmage


### TEACHING THROUGH FILM

Hustle film tagged separate from performance film

Highlight reels for effort not just “yay” points

Top culture player announced weekly with staff + player vote


### WHY THIS IS HIGH-MAJOR STANDARD

Role players earn time through culture grades

Leaders are built through hustle film

Energy metrics are tied to scout selection and late-game closers




## SECTION 8.4 – LEADERSHIP & EMOTIONAL DISCIPLINE METRICS

We don’t just grade execution, we grade poise.


### WHAT WE TRACK AT ELITE LEVELS

Captain resets (voice, timing, content)

Post-mistake behavior: does the player slump, lead, reset?

Leadership under fatigue (segment leadership index)

Emotional reaction time to correction (graded 1–5 per mistake)


### LIVE FILM INTEGRATION

Every practice filmed. Every rep clipped. Leadership moments tagged.

Captains reviewed weekly with leadership film clips

Captains submit scout tone plan before each walkthrough


### SYSTEMIZED EMOTIONAL TRAINING

Weekly culture block: 1 theme, 1 tone rep, 1 emotional reset drill

Practices include adversity segments: bad call drills, momentum flips

Captains lead post-error huddles staff silent


### WHY THIS IS NBA / PRO STANDARD

Emotional intelligence is teachable and we train it like PnR reads

Captains learn to lead without panic or ego

Discipline under fatigue = wins in March




## SECTION 8.5 – KPI GROWTH TRACKING & PLAYER DEVELOPMENT CHARTS

Growth isn’t verbal it’s visual, data-backed, and unavoidable.


### HOW IT’S STRUCTURED

KPI updates bi-weekly for all players

Color-coded growth chart: Green (↑3+), Yellow (±2), Red (↓3+)

Traits tracked: Physical Tools, Athleticism, Skill, IQ, Defense, Motor, Productivity, Fit

Trait-by-trait staff notes logged: “IQ +2 → reads vs. late help improved”


### VISUAL DASHBOARD

Practice film + KPI chart linked inside The Program Bible

Players see their own trendline not guess

Coaches adjust roles based on verified growth, not assumption


### HOW IT’S USED

Minutes earned through role alignment + KPI track

Scout team selections tied to KPI response (who’s growing under adversity)

Development players get tangible feedback tied to rep volume


### WHY THIS IS D1/NBA LEVEL

Growth is visual, audible, and posted

KPI progression becomes part of culture not just evaluation

Players develop belief through structure, not blind faith




## SECTION 8.6 – PRACTICE FILM INTEGRATION & AUTOMATED CHARTING SYSTEM

Every practice is filmed. Every rep is charted. Every action is evaluated.


### WHAT WE FILM + CHART

Shot selection + shot value

Voice reps + scout echoing

Effort + recovery

Closeouts, rotations, decision breakdowns

Captain resets and tone control


### HOW IT’S DONE

Practice filmed from two angles (side + baseline)

Charting handled by AI-based software + assistant clips

Chart feeds into KPI, Culture Grade, and scout prep


### PLAYER INTEGRATION

Players receive chart summary 24 hours post-practice

Red-tag reps are clipped and reviewed in team film

Leaders held to a higher charting standard vocal reps, resets, correction speed


### WHY THIS IS NBA PREP LEVEL

NBA teams chart every rep. So do we.

Practice becomes competitive, not casual

Every action is tracked. Every breakdown is corrected. Every growth cue is visible



We don’t talk about getting better. We measure it.
We don’t guess who’s leading. We prove it.
At Florida Memorial, metrics don’t just support the system they are the system.




## SECTION 9.1 – PLAYER DEVELOPMENT CASE STUDIES

We don’t coach talent. We coach transformation.
Every case listed here reflects a player I personally developed through structure, discipline, and system clarity. These are not stories of natural rise. They’re stories of system-driven change.

ORLANDO ROBINSON – From Unknown to NBA Center

Before: Couldn’t dunk, lacked confidence, not a starter in high school

After: Daily training, lived in my house, became a skilled high-major big and is now on his fourth NBA contract

Development Focus: Footwork, emotional maturity, pro habits

OMARI MOORE – From Raw Athlete to Mountain West POY + NBA Signee

Before: No offers, poor handle, unclear position

After: Converted to PG, became Mountain West Player of the Year, signed with both the Toronto Raptors and Milwaukee Bucks

Development Focus:** Pick-and-roll IQ, handle under pressure, defensive identity

TONE HUNTER – From Undisciplined to NCAA Tourney Upset

Before: Emotionally reactive, lacked structure, overlooked

After: Became elite on-ball point guard, vocal floor general, JUCO POY, Signed with Oakland integral in upsetting Kentucky

Development Focus: Shot selection, trusting teammates, defensive leadership

DEMARION POUNCIL – From Injury Risk to D2-Athlete

Before: Constant injury issues, no jumpshot, lost love of the game

After: Found love of the game, became a knockdown shooter as a big man

Development Focus: Body transformation, mental discipline, Jumpshot overhaul

GARY HARRIS – From Lost Offer to D1

Before: Got offer rescinded, lack of jumper and work ethic questions

After: Standout at the D1 level now playing professional in China

Development Focus: Jumper complete rework, emotional trust, film study habits

MICHAEL ONYEBALU – From Playing out of Position to UC Davis Signee

Before: Raw, predominantly played power forward only at 6’4

After: Became true pg, highly skilled with college-ready ability, starter on UC davis first ever NCAA Tourney team

Development Focus: Pg IQ, intense ball handling

These players didn’t just evolve. They were developed through a real system — and they grew because we tracked, taught, and enforced every layer.




## SECTION 9.2 – BEFORE/AFTER METRICS CHART

We don’t talk about growth. We measure it. This chart reflects 20 real players I’ve coached with honest, visible transformation across every level.




## SECTION 9.3 – DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK: WHY THESE PLAYERS GOT BETTER

We don’t just develop players. We develop professionals.

The players who made it through my system to the NBA, to Europe, to D1 didn’t do it because they were talented. They made it because we built a real structure that grew with them and held them accountable when no one else did. This section breaks down the three systems behind that growth the same ones I’ll bring to Florida Memorial.



KourtVision – Evaluation Engine
KourtVision is my proprietary player evaluation and projection system. It grades every athlete on 30+ core traits like Physical Tools, Athleticism, Skill Level, Playmaking IQ, Defense, Motor, Productivity, and System Fit, and assigns a 0–100 KPI score that projects role, level, and upside.


**Every player I recruit or coach is run through KourtVision:**

No guesswork, no hype

Role clarity from Day 1

Skill-specific development plans tied to their lowest traits

Real-time KPI growth tracking over weeks and months

NBA guys like Orlando Robinson didn’t start out being great. But we tracked his growth thoroughly and now I have created it into a plug and play system that can be used for all athletes.

KourtVision isn’t just about who to recruit, it's how I develop, structure minutes, build lineups, and challenge leaders.



The Program Bible – Operations System
Development dies without structure. That’s why I built The Program Bible a full-stack accountability engine that governs every aspect of our culture, practice, discipline, and leadership development.


**Everything lives inside it:**

Practice reps (charting, volume, red tags)

Scout performance and role adherence

Culture grades (tone, huddle resets, talk)

Academic check-ins, calendar syncs, captain feedback

This isn’t a spreadsheet. It’s a real-time system that replaces what most D1 programs outsource to 3–4 staff members. I built it because I had no staff and still had to win.


**Through The Program Bible, I am able to track:**

Emotional breakdown recovery (who bounces back vs. who fades)

Leadership reps (who talks when it’s hard)

Dorm culture slippage (who needs a reset)

I’ve used it to maintain discipline, promote captains, fix locker room drift, and build winning cultures under pressure. It’s the backbone of how I develop grown men, not just highlight tapes.




**IDPs – Individual Development Plans
Every player gets an IDP based on their KPI + culture profile. These plans are:**

Trait-specific (e.g., "IQ +2 = expand reads vs. double")

Role-aware (e.g., "Defensive wing: must lead closeout, rotation talk")

Updated bi-weekly using film, KourtVision, and coach tags


**IDPs are tracked inside The Program Bible, linked to practice film, and shared with staff. They inform how I:**

Assign minutes

Design drill segments

Choose scout teams

Structure feedback

When a player earns a leadership role, it’s logged. When a player slips, it’s caught. No one floats. Everyone knows where they stand.



Why This Works at the Highest Level

KourtVision removes bias — so we coach who they are, not who they pretend to be.

The Program Bible removes excuses — so players can’t hide, and staff can’t miss.

IDPs remove confusion — so growth is constant, role clarity is real, and players stay.

I’ve helped build multiple pros, 30+ college athletes, and full rosters with no scholarships.

Not because I had resources. Because I had a system.

At Florida Memorial, that system is already built and it’s ready to scale.




## SECTION 9.4 – THE GROWTH LAB: TURNING SYSTEMS INTO OUTCOMES

Player development isn’t a segment. It’s an ecosystem and we built a system to make it real.

The Growth Lab is our elite development model where every player receives a 2-week improvement cycle rooted in film, skill tracking, accountability, and pro comparison.



2-Week Film + Skill Plan


**Every two weeks, each player receives a personalized growth plan based on:**

KourtVision trait data

Practice film from live reps

Red-tag breakdowns (shot selection, spacing errors, missed talk)


**Plans include:**

Skill emphasis (e.g., shooting windows, relocation, closeout timing)

Decision upgrades (e.g., reads vs. blitz, help-side rotation talk)

Culture targets (e.g., voice volume, scout resets, huddle leadership)

Pro Comparison Film Cutups


**Players are shown side-by-side breakdowns of:**

Their game vs. NBA or overseas players at their position

Examples of what elite looks like — footwork, spacing, talk, reads

Direct connection to pro mentors: past players, pros I’ve trained, or team connections

This gives players vision. Not just feedback. They don’t just see what’s wrong they see what’s possible.



Charted Reps + AI Feedback


**Every drill in practice is filmed and charted:**

Shot charting (green/yellow/red)

Talk reps (who led, who reset, who hid)

Effort recovery, spacing errors, tempo breakdowns

Charts are fed into the Program Bible and reviewed by players during development meetings



Leadership Feedback Loop

Captains review teammate tone, scout prep, and reset leadership weekly

Leaders are trained to give clean, calm, non-emotional correction and logged when they do

“Tone Fails” are tagged and reviewed just like missed rotations



Why It Works

Most programs review game film. We film the work.

Most coaches correct performance. We correct voice, tempo, and presence.

Most development is blind. Ours is measured, reviewed, and designed.

The Growth Lab is how we turn athletes into pros, shooters, leaders, culture builders.
And it’s not a theory. It’s already working.




## SECTION 9.5 – PLAYER VOICE SYSTEM: DEVELOPMENT YOU CAN HEAR

You don’t just see growth in our program. You hear it. And we coach it.

Player voice isn’t optional it’s a trained behavior. Our system treats communication as a skill, just like shooting or decision-making. If you don’t talk, you don’t play. If you lead vocally, you earn real responsibility.




**System Features:**

Voice Reps Graded: Every rep is tracked — from drill to live scrimmage to walk-through. Players are scored on clarity, timing, tone, and echo.


**Leadership Tracks: Players level up through a structured pathway:**

Level 1 – Tone Follower (quiet, no reps)

Level 2 – Talk Contributor (must echo scout, communicate defensively)

Level 3 – Segment Leader (runs group huddles, scout calls, warmups)

Level 4 – Captain (resets tone, runs team talks, leads scout discipline)

Reset Leadership Training: Players are coached on when to lead, how to lead, and how to correct peers without emotion. We rep this weekly.

Bench Talk Grading: Players off the court are tracked for energy, communication, scout confirmation, and body language. Talk from the sideline is expected, not optional.

Scout Talk Quizzes: Captains and guards are tested on their ability to lead scout language in real time.




**Why It Matters:**

Voice = Confidence – The more players talk, the more ownership they feel

Talk = Readiness – If you can’t echo scout calls, you’re not ready to play

Leadership = Role Security – In our system, quiet guys don’t start

Every elite team has culture. Ours has voice tracked, coached, and measured.

Because in our system, talk travels. And leaders are heard before they’re seen.



At Florida Memorial, development isn’t a concept. It’s a system. It’s proven. And it’s already built.
We don’t guess who’s improving. We show you.




## SECTION 10.1 – SHORT-TERM + LONG-TERM PROGRAM GOALS

We don’t set goals to sound ambitious. We set them to structure daily work with measurable outcomes that reflect growth, retention, pro potential, and brand power.




### YEAR ONE GOALS:

25+ wins

Top-3 Sun Conference finish

Top-25 national ranking

NAIA Tournament qualification and first-round win

Full system install (KourtVision + Program Bible)

2 players identified as future pros through system-based projection

Launch player NIL onboarding system using KPI and film cutups




### YEAR TWO GOALS:

Returners lead culture scout install, huddles, and growth voice

Win the Sun Conference

Reach NAIA Sweet 16

3+ active NIL partnerships secured through player-brand integration

At least 1 overseas or pro-track signing through verified development plan




### YEAR THREE+ GOALS:

NAIA Final Four contention

National Top-10 ranking

2–3 players signed to overseas or G-League contracts

Build national identity as a pro-prep destination at the NAIA level

Retain 85% of roster with full role clarity + development buy-in




## SECTION 10.2 – YEARLY EVALUATION MODEL

We evaluate everything because the standard is built on truth.
This model ensures we know exactly where the program is growing, where it’s slipping, and how to fix it from players to culture to wins.


**Player Growth Evaluation:**

KPI Growth by Trait Category: Film-based analysis of progression in skill, IQ, motor, and system fit

Development Plan Completion: Players are graded on their IDP performance every 2 weeks

Voice & Leadership Grading: Captains and upperclassmen evaluated on tone, emotional resets, and scout control

Academic + Time Management: Missed classes, tardiness, and GPA drops trigger flags in The Program Bible


**Culture Health Monitoring:**

Practice Energy Logs: Voice, reset reps, and effort rated Green/Yellow/Red each session

Scout Discipline: % of correct coverage reps vs. slippage in drills and games

Bench Engagement + Body Language: Captured on film and scored weekly

Huddle and Timeout Tone: Are players leading or hiding?


**Program Performance Metrics:**

Win/Loss Record with Scout Grade Correlation: We grade how closely our scout success predicts actual outcomes

Margin of Execution: Difference between expected outcome and in-game breakdowns

Retention Rate by Role Tier: We track why players leave culture, role confusion, or personal reasons

Transfer Success Score: Where did players go? Are they still playing? Are they performing?

Graduation Rate + Eligibility Tracking: Academic and athletic progress are tracked equally


**Why This Matters:**

We don’t wait for problems to become crises

We track emotional leadership just like shooting form

We correct slippage before it becomes identity

At Florida Memorial, evaluation isn’t emotional. It’s operational.
Because if we don’t measure it, we can’t improve it.


## SECTION 10.3 – PRO DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE: FROM REPS TO RESULTS

We don’t just develop players. We prepare professionals with a system that mimics how NBA and overseas programs evaluate talent.

Step 1: Evaluation-Based Projection

Every player is evaluated through our internal KourtVision system — scored across 8 traits, reviewed by staff only

Each athlete is given a realistic projection tier based on film, physical tools, system fit, and growth curve: NAIA Contributor, D2 Starter, D1 Transfer Potential, Overseas-Pro, NBA-Track

Players don’t see their raw KPI numbers  but they receive clear, honest feedback about where they stand in relation to the next level

We’re transparent: “You’re currently at a strong NAIA level. Here’s what needs to improve if you want to play D2 or go overseas.”

Step 2: Role + Trait Alignment

Development plans are custom-built based on role and deficiencies

Example: Combo guard with 68 KPI → must improve IQ (+2), Motor (+1), Shot selection

Big with 75 KPI → focus on switch coverage, body control, and emotional consistency

Every 2 weeks, red-tag film and practice data are reviewed to shape next-step growth targets

Step 3: Pro Comparison Film Cutups

Players are shown side-by-sides with current or past pros with similar tools

“This is what a 6’8” pro 4-man looks like here’s how your reads compare”

“This guard’s footwork at the rim is why he gets paid you need this counter”

Film is sliced with targeted annotation not hype reels, but teachable comparisons

Step 4: Pro Mentorship + Market Access

Former players (NBA, Europe, G-League) review player film and provide direct feedback

Players are connected to real mentors, not social media trainers guys who have lived it


**Seniors and pro-track players are coached on:**

How to build an agent-ready portfolio

What scouts and decision-makers actually care about

How to train without being watched

Step 5: Pro Habits Built Inside The Growth Lab


**Players are taught daily:**

How to lead through fatigue

How to reset after mistakes

How to speak like a professional no finger-pointing, no slouching, no hiding

Every rep is charted. Every film session matters. Every detail is coached to the highest standard.

This isn’t marketing. It’s preparation.
Most programs hope a player breaks through.
We train players to be professionals with structure, truth, and real system clarity.




## SECTION 10.4 – FUNDRAISING, NIL, AND REVENUE STRATEGY

Most coaches talk culture. I also build capital and I treat fundraising like a skill, not a hope.


**What I’ve Already Done:**

Generated $165K+ in tuition revenue at a school with no scholarships, no gym, and no recruiting budget

Closed full-pay internationals by selling the system not flash

Built full rosters from scratch with zero institutional support


**How We Raise Funds at FMU:**

Recruit tuition-positive players who want development and structure

Offer behind-the-scenes donor access to film sessions, The Growth Lab, and leadership summits

Host speaker series, coaches clinics, and paid development sessions that bring visibility and revenue

Build branded FMU “Culture Camp” events for youth + local programs

Partner with academic departments for business/NIL workshops funded by sponsorships

Launch donor-specific content streams with weekly coach updates, player features, and KPI insights


**NIL Integration + Monetization Strategy:**

Every player taught how to build a professional NIL portfolio using film, KPI, leadership reps, and academic alignment

Create a Film + Value Index to show local businesses the real ROI of partnering with FMU players (e.g. visibility, voice, GPA)

Tie NIL to leadership players earn opportunities based on maturity, discipline, and role clarity

Host NIL media days with local sponsors to generate community buy-in and exposure


**The Long-Term Plan:**

Build a self-sustaining ecosystem around FMU basketball: development revenue, brand value, player NIL monetization, and donor growth

Package and license parts of the system (e.g. Growth Lab curriculum, KourtVision templates) for regional clinics

Turn FMU into a destination for player growth and entrepreneurial energy

At Florida Memorial, revenue isn’t luck. It’s leadership.
And when a coach brings structure, every dollar has direction.




## SECTION 10.5 – REVENUE STREAMS BY CATEGORY

Fundraising isn’t just one event it’s a system. We approach revenue like we approach player development: structured, repeatable, and scalable.


**Player-Driven Streams:**

Tuition from full-pay and partial scholarship athletes

Branded development clinics featuring current roster talent

Growth Lab access for high school or JUCO athletes (select pay-to-train pipeline)


**Community-Driven Streams:**

Youth development nights, community days, and team-led mentorship camps

Coaches’ Clinics + Speaker Panels sponsored by local small businesses

Joint fundraising with academic departments (leadership, sports business)


**Brand-Driven Streams:**

NIL platform partnerships (metrics-based pitch decks for player profiles)

Film + KPI media library access for training and donor packages

Sponsored social content + livestream breakdowns with player features


**Alumni/Donor-Driven Streams:**

Donor tier system with content and access tied to each level

Quarterly leadership reports from Coach K’s Program Bible

Exclusive FMU Team Day (Growth Lab walkthrough, dinner, Q&A with coach + captains)

Our goal is to turn FMU basketball into a revenue generator not just a cost center.
With structure, transparency, and alignment, we’ll become a donor-supported engine with real ROI.




## SECTION 10.6 – FMU LEGACY FUND: BUILDING A CHAMPIONSHIP-BACKED BRAND

Every championship program is backed by vision and resourced by buy-in. But buy-in doesn’t come from slogans. It comes from structure, results, and real strategic planning.


**The FMU Legacy Fund is our multi-phase capital campaign to build a championship-backed identity:**

Anchored in measurable development outcomes: pro contracts, graduation rates, NIL conversions, retention rates

Designed to show donors exactly what their support produces: wins, leaders, and long-term ROI

Supported by a media and messaging engine that gives donors real access to the journey not just the scoreboard




**Legacy Fund Phase 1 – Foundation Build (Year 1–2):**

Establish donor tiers and funding pathways tied directly to player development milestones

Launch Growth Lab Spotlight Series: monthly donor-facing content with practice film, pro mentorship, and player voice clips

Begin core fundraising push for facility upgrades, weight room branding, and leadership room renovations


**Legacy Fund Phase 2 – Culture Expansion (Year 2–3):**

Annual Legacy Week: donor, alumni, and family weekend anchored in film sessions, Growth Lab open walkthrough, and player-led panels

Launch the FMU NIL Incubator: student-led media, brand pitch decks, and partner alignment

Produce annual FMU Development Report: showing player growth metrics, win trends, and retention ROI


**Legacy Fund Phase 3 – Championship Reinforcement (Year 4+):**

Secure naming rights for program infrastructure (e.g., Growth Lab Media Center, Leadership Hub)

Fund scholarship stacking for high-need, high-character players to protect long-term retention

Host National Development Combine: invite-only event for NAIA/D2 prospects run through our Growth Lab framework FMU becomes the hub




**What Makes This Different:**

Donors don’t just write checks. They see results.

Stories are documented, shared, and tied to tangible growth.

ROI is defined by impact and proven every quarter.

This isn’t a hope-driven fundraiser. This is a system-based investment engine.
The FMU Legacy Fund doesn’t just support a team. It builds a standard.




## SECTION 11.1 – DORM LIFE & CAMPUS CULTURE PLAN

We don’t just build culture in the gym, we build it in the dorms, in the cafeteria, and across campus.

At Florida Memorial, every player in our program will represent more than a jersey. They’ll represent a standard. That means our off-court habits must match our on-court intensity: mature, present, accountable, and consistent.

Dorm life and campus presence aren’t distractions. They’re part of player development.




### DORM SYSTEM STRUCTURE

Room assignments paired intentionally upperclassman leaders with underclassmen

Weekly culture check-ins: room cleanliness, sleep habits, team trust

Roster-wide curfew protocol: enforced by captains, backed by staff

Random walk-throughs for accountability and presence — no surprises




### CAMPUS PRESENCE MODEL

Players trained to introduce themselves with presence “Name, team, and leadership role”

Class behavior monitored missed class = missed minutes

Players assigned campus tone roles: academic rep, cafeteria voice, dorm floor lead

Staff visible in common spaces film, lunch, walkthroughs all used as culture checkpoints




### OFF-CAMPUS HABITS

Players taught calendar habits not just for basketball, but for life

Social media monitored for brand integrity players reflect the program

Team standards include community tone we walk with purpose wherever we go

Missteps handled through structure: education, conversation, and consequence




### LEADERSHIP IN THE DORM

Captains trained to lead without emotion reset tone, not escalate

Freshmen mentored on life off the floor: time, talk, and how to carry themselves

Weekly check-in block in The Program Bible players log accountability wins and growth needs

Leadership moments tracked: who leads dorm clean-up? Who addresses volume? Who de-escalates?



We don’t outsource leadership. We build it, in every hallway and every huddle.

At Florida Memorial, dorm life will reflect game life. We’ll show up sharp, lead with presence, and represent something bigger than ourselves 24/7.

Because culture doesn’t clock out. And neither do we.




## SECTION 11.2 – APPLICATION WRAP-UP LETTER

To the hiring committee,

This opportunity means more to me than just the next job. Florida Memorial represents everything I believe in: mission, culture, and momentum. You’ve already proven you can win. Now it’s time to build something sustainable, something that lasts.

That’s what I’ve done my entire career. I’ve led programs with no scholarships, no gym, and no staff, and still built rosters, developed pros, and generated results through structure and culture. Now I’m ready to lead with full support and scale a program that already has the foundation.


**What I bring is more than a philosophy. It’s a system:**

A KPI model that evaluates, recruits, and tracks player growth with real accuracy

A film-based player development system that builds skill, voice, and maturity

A staff culture rooted in tone, truth, and intentional leadership

A recruiting engine already delivering D1, D2, NAIA, and overseas outcomes

A discipline-first mindset that players buy into and stay with

Everything you’ve read in this portfolio isn’t hypothetical. It’s what I’ve already built and it’s ready to lead Florida Memorial to the next level.

Thank you for your time, your consideration, and your belief in this process.

Let’s build something special together.

Sincerely,

Coach Sammy Kalejaiye
